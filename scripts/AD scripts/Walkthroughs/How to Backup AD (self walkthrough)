Install windows server backup, once installed open the windows server backup window. 
On the right panel, choose backup once, then go through the wizard and choose the necessary files to backup.
        NOTE: You cannot backup the entire server, must choose specific files/config files to backup. You can back these up to the C: drive
Backup the files to the C: drive. When done, make the file a zip file and then password protect it. Place it in somewhere like documents and name it something not obvious. 

        NOTE 2: DO NOT DO THIS UNTIL YOU HAVE THE SERVER IN A COMFORTABLE STATE.
